HW1 PART1 is 100% completed


Approach:
I based my work on the sample code "snyfer.c".
0. The code to attach and detach/terminate process was taken directly from "snyfer.c"
1. "ptrace(PTRACE_SINGLESTEP...)" was used to pause the process at every instruction
2. "ptrace(GETREGS...)" was used to retrieve instrution address from EIP
3. "ptrace(PEEKTEXT...)" was used to read the instruction pointed by EIP
4. Pass the 4-byte data to udis86 and have it disassembled
5. udis86 will guess instruction length from the first 4-byte data
6. If instruction length is greater than 4-byte, retrieve the additional bytes via "ptrace(PEEKTEXT...eip+4...)"
7. have udis86 disassemble again
