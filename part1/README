HW1 PART1 is 100% completed

Approach:
I based my work on the sample code "snyfer.c".
0. The code to attach and detach/terminate process was taken directly from "snyfer.c"
1. "ptrace(PTRACE_SINGLESTEP...)" was used to pause the process at every instruction
2. "ptrace(GETREGS...)" was used to retrieve instrution address from EIP
3. "ptrace(PEEKTEXT...)" was used to read the instruction pointed by EIP
4. The raw instruction was fed into udis86 and disassembled.
